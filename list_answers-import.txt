Explan:Understanding the business need occurs as part of analyzing the current state. The BABOK says, "Without clearly understood business needs, it is impossible to develop a coherent strategy, and the resulting change initiative is almost certain to be driven by a mix of conflicting stakeholder demands.” Resolving the conflict consists of mediation among stakeholders and involves several steps.
